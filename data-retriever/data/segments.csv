Business Segments DescriptionDevices and Consumer
  Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and 
  services designed to increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks 
  and make more informed decisions online, entertain and connect people, and help 
  advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C segments are made up of D&C 
  Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other.

D&C Licensing
  The principal products and services provided by the D&C Licensing segment 
  are: Windows, including original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) 
  licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic 
  volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume 
  licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers 
  (“Office Consumer”); Windows Phone operating system, including related 
  patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue.
  The Windows operating system is designed to empower individuals, companies, 
  and organizations to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across 
  the user’s hardware and software.

Windows revenue growth is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating 
  system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they 
  sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is impacted 
  by:
  
  the mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size; 
 
  differences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets;
 
  attachment of Windows to devices shipped;
 
  customer mix between consumer, small and medium sized businesses, and large 
  enterprises;
 
  changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel;
 
  pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of 
  devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large, 
  multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed;
 piracy; and sales of packaged software.
The versions of Office included in our D&C Licensing segment are designed 
  to increase personal productivity through a range of programs, services, and 
  software solutions. Growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product 
  set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other areas such as content 
  management and collaboration. Office Consumer revenue is impacted by sales to 
  customers that buy Office with their new devices and by product launches, as 
  well as the transition to Office 365 Consumer, our subscription-based cloud 
  service that provides access to Office plus other productivity services. Office 
  365 Consumer revenue is included in our D&C Other segment.

  The Windows Phone operating system is designed to bring users closer to the 
  people, applications, and content they need. As noted above, prior to our acquisition 
  of NDS, Microsoft and Nokia jointly created new mobile products and services 
  and extended established products and services to new markets through a strategic 
  alliance. Windows Phone revenue associated with this contractual relationship 
  was reflected in D&C Licensing. Windows Phone revenue also includes revenue 
  from licensing mobile-related patents.
Computing and Gaming Hardware
  The principal products and services provided by the Computing and Gaming Hardware 
  segment are: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories, second-party 
  and third-party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions (“Xbox 
  Platform”); Surface devices and accessories; and Microsoft PC accessories.
  The Xbox Platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment choices 
  through the use of our devices, peripherals, content, and online services. We 
  released Xbox 360 and Xbox One in November 2005 and November 2013, respectively.
  Surface devices are designed to help organizations, students, and consumers 
  to be more productive, offering accessories and compatibility with peripherals. 
  Surface devices were first released in October 2012. Our latest Surface device, 
  the Surface Pro 3, was released in June 2014.
Phone Hardware
  The principal products and services provided by the new Phone Hardware segment 
  are Lumia Smartphones and other non-Lumia phones, which we began manufacturing 
  and selling with the acquisition of NDS on April 25, 2014.
D&C Other
  The principal products and services provided by the D&C Other segment are: 
  Resale, including the Windows Store, Xbox Live transactions, and the Windows 
  Phone Store; search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising 
  Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video 
  games; and our retail stores.
  Windows Store and Windows Phone Store are online application marketplaces that 
  are designed to benefit our developers and partner ecosystems by providing access 
  to a large customer base and benefit users by providing centralized access to 
  certified applications. Xbox Live transactions consist of online entertainment 
  content, such as games, music, movies, and TV shows, accessible on Xbox consoles 
  and other devices.
  Search and display advertising includes Bing, Bing Ads, MSN, Windows Services, 
  and Xbox ads. We are the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for 
  Yahoo! websites worldwide. We have completed the Yahoo! worldwide algorithmic 
  transition and the paid search transition in the U.S. and planned international 
  markets.

Office 365 Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a 
  range of Microsoft Office programs and services delivered across multiple platforms 
  via the cloud.

Studios designs and markets games for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, 
  and online. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users and increase 
  engagement by developing a deep library of content which consumers seek.
Commercial
  Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed 
  to increase individual, team, and organization productivity and efficiency, 
  and to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user’s 
  hardware and software. Commercial is made up of the Commercial Licensing and 
  Commercial Other segments.

Commercial Licensing
  The principal products and services provided by the Commercial Licensing segment 
  are: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual 
  Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CAL”); 
  Windows Embedded; volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding 
  academic (“Windows Commercial”); Microsoft Office for business, 
  including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and related CAL (“Office 
  Commercial”); Skype; and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding 
  Dynamics CRM Online.

Our server products are designed to make information technology professionals 
  and developers and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software 
  is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software 
  applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the 
  server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, 
  virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity 
  software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools 
  for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Revenue 
  comes from product revenue, including purchases through volume licensing programs, 
  licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged product. CAL provide access rights 
  to certain server and Office products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL 
  Server, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync. CAL revenue is reported along with the 
  associated server or Office product.

Windows Embedded extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent 
  systems, including the Internet of Things, by delivering specialized operating 
  systems, tools, and services.

Windows Commercial revenue is mainly affected by the demand from commercial 
  customers for volume licensing and software assurance, often reflecting the 
  number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively 
  independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.
  The versions of Office in Commercial Licensing are designed to increase personal, 
  team and organizational productivity through a range of programs, services, 
  and software solutions. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination 
  of the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and software assurance 
  and the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore 
  relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.
  Skype is designed to connect friends, family, clients, and colleagues through 
  a variety of devices. Revenue is largely driven by the sale of minutes, subscriptions, 
  and advertising.

Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, 
  customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications 
  for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global 
  enterprises. Revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers 
  licensed.
Commercial Other
  The principal products and services provided by the Commercial Other segment 
  are: Enterprise Services, including Premier product support services and Microsoft 
  Consulting Services; Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365 Commercial, other 
  Microsoft Office online offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure.


  Enterprise Services, including Premier product support services and Microsoft 
  Consulting Services assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing 
  Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification 
  to developers and information technology professionals on various Microsoft 
  products.
  Office 365 Commercial is an online services offering that includes Microsoft 
  Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync, and is available across a variety of 
  devices and platforms.

Dynamics CRM Online is designed to provide customer relationship management 
  and supply chain management for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, 
  and divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is largely driven by the number 
  of information workers licensed.
  Microsoft Azure is a scalable operating system with computing, storage, database, 
  and management, along with comprehensive cloud solutions, from which customers 
  can build, deploy, and manage enterprise workloads and web applications. These 
  services also include a platform that helps developers build and connect applications 
  and services in the cloud. Our goal is to enable customers to devote more resources 
  to development and use of applications that benefit their businesses, rather 
  than managing on-premises hardware and software.

Business Segments DescriptionRetail
  Our Retail segment is organized into two businesses: Life & Other and Annuities.
  The major products within Life & Other are as follows:
  Variable Life. Variable life products provide insurance coverage through a contract 
  that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending 
  on the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with certain guarantees. 
  Most importantly, with variable life products, premiums and account balances 
  can be directed by the policyholder into a variety of separate account investment 
  options or directed to the Company’s general account. In the separate 
  account investment options, the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment 
  results. We collect specified fees for the management of the investment options. 
  The policyholder’s cash value reflects the investment return of the selected 
  investment options, net of management fees and insurance-related and other charges. 
  In some instances, third-party money management firms manage these investment 
  options. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders 
  may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit 
  from adverse investment experience.
  Universal Life. Universal life products provide insurance coverage on the same 
  basis as variable life, except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated 
  balances, are allocated only to the Company’s general account. Universal 
  life products may allow the insured to increase or decrease the amount of death 
  benefit coverage over the term of the contract and the owner to adjust the frequency 
  and amount of premium payments. We credit premiums to an account maintained 
  for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified expenses. Interest 
  is credited to the policyholder’s account at interest rates we determine, 
  subject to specified minimums. Specific charges are made against the policyholder’s 
  account for the cost of insurance protection and for expenses. With some products, 
  by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage 
  of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment 
  experience.
 Term Life. Term life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death 
  of the insured for a specified time period in return for the periodic payment 
  of premiums. Specified coverage periods range from one year to 30 years, but 
  in no event are they longer than the period over which premiums are paid. Death 
  benefits may be level over the period or decreasing. Premiums may be guaranteed 
  at a level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and non-guaranteed. 
  Term insurance products are sometimes referred to as pure protection products, 
  in that there are typically no savings or investment elements. Term contracts 
  expire without value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party 
  is still living.
  Whole Life. Whole life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death 
  of the insured in return for the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a 
  predetermined period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of 
  the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be level or change 
  in accordance with a predetermined schedule. Whole life insurance includes policies 
  that provide a participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders 
  may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death benefits, increase 
  cash values available upon surrender or reduce the premiums required to maintain 
  the contract in-force. Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder, 
  this group of products provides significant flexibility to individuals to tailor 
  the product to suit their specific needs and circumstances, while at the same 
  time providing guaranteed benefits.
  Disability. Disability products provide a benefit in the event of the disability 
  of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income 
  paid until the insured reaches age 
In addition to income replacement, the product may be used to provide for the 
  payment of business overhead expenses for disabled business owners or mortgage 
  payment protection.
  Property & Casualty. These products include personal lines property & 
  casualty insurance offered to individuals through a variety of retail distribution 
  channels, including independent agents, property & casualty specialists, 
  and the MetLife Premier Client Group, formerly known as our individual distribution 
  sales force. 
Auto insurance policies provide coverage for private passenger automobiles, 
  utility automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or classic automobiles 
  and trailers. We also offer traditional coverage such as liability, uninsured 
  motorist, no fault or personal injury protection, as well as collision and comprehensive 
  insurance.
  Homeowners’ insurance policies provide protection for homeowners, renters, 
  condominium owners and residential landlords against losses arising out of damage 
  to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well as coverage 
  for liability arising from ownership or occupancy. Other insurance includes 
  personal excess liability (protection against losses in excess of amounts covered 
  by other liability insurance policies), and coverage for recreational vehicles 
  and boat owners. Most of our homeowners’ policies are traditional insurance 
  policies for dwellings, providing protection for loss on a “replacement 
  cost” basis. These policies also provide additional coverage for reasonable, 
  normal living expenses incurred by policyholders that have been displaced from 
  their homes.
Other. Additionally, through our broker-dealer affiliates, we offer a full 
  range of mutual funds and other securities products. The elimination of transactions 
  from activity between the segments within the Americas occurs within Life & 
  Other.
  Our Annuities business offers a variety of variable and fixed annuities that 
  are primarily sold to individuals and tax-qualified groups in the education, 
  healthcare and not-for-profit sectors.
  The major products within Annuities are as follows:

Variable Annuities. Variable annuities provide for both asset accumulation 
  and asset distribution needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to 
  make deposits into various investment options in a separate account, as determined 
  by the contractholder. The risks associated with such investment options are 
  borne entirely by the contractholder, except where guaranteed minimum benefits 
  are involved. In certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also 
  choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the Company’s 
  general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject 
  to specified minimums. In addition, contractholders may also elect certain minimum 
  death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees 
  are charged and where asset allocation restrictions may apply.
  Fixed Annuities. Fixed annuities provide for both asset accumulation and asset 
  distribution needs. Fixed annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility 
  provided by variable annuities, but provide guarantees related to the preservation 
  of principal and interest credited. Deposits made into deferred annuity contracts 
  are allocated to the Company’s general account and are credited with interest 
  at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Credited interest rates 
  are guaranteed not to change for certain limited periods of time, ranging from 
  one to 10 years. Fixed income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income 
  for a specified period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits
  We have built a leading position in the U.S. group insurance market through 
  long-standing relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in 
  the U.S. Our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment is organized into 
  two businesses: Group and Voluntary & Worksite.
  Our Group insurance products and services include life, dental, group short- 
  and long-term disability and AD&D coverages. We also sell administrative 
  services-only (“ASO”) arrangements to some employers. Under such 
  ASO arrangements, the employer is at risk, as we have not issued an insurance 
  policy. We pay claims funded by the employer and perform other administrative 
  services on behalf of the employer.
The major products within Group are as follows:
  Life. Life insurance products and services include variable life, universal 
  life, and term life products. These are similar to the products offered by the 
  Retail Life & Other business except we offer group insurance products as 
  employer-paid benefits or as voluntary benefits where all or a portion of the 
  premiums are paid by the employee. These life insurance products and services 
  also include employee paid supplemental life and are offered as standard products 
  or may be tailored to meet specific customer needs.
  Dental. Dental products provide insurance and ASO arrangements that assist employees, 
  retirees and their families in maintaining oral health while reducing out-of-pocket 
  expenses and providing superior customer service. Dental plans include the Preferred 
  Dentist Program and the Dental Health Maintenance Organization.
  Disability. Disability products provide a benefit in the event of the disability 
  of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income 
  paid until the insured reaches age 
  Our Voluntary & Worksite products and services include long-term care (“LTC”), 
  prepaid legal plans, critical illness and property & casualty products.

The major products within Voluntary & Worksite are as follows:
  Long-term Care. LTC products provide protection against the potentially high 
  costs of LTC services. They generally pay benefits to insureds who need assistance 
  with activities of daily living or have a cognitive impairment. Although we 
  discontinued the sale of these products in 2010, we continue to support our 
  existing policyholders.
  Property & Casualty. These products include personal lines property & 
  casualty insurance offered directly to employees at their employer’s worksite 
  through a variety of distribution channels, including independent agents, property 
  & casualty specialists and direct marketing. The property & casualty 
  products offered by the Voluntary & Worksite business are the same products 
  offered by the Retail property & casualty business.
Corporate Benefit Funding
  The Corporate Benefit Funding segment provides funding and financing solutions 
  that help institutional customers mitigate and manage liabilities primarily 
  associated with their qualified, nonqualified and welfare employee benefit programs 
  using a spectrum of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products.
  The major products within Corporate Benefit Funding are as follows:
  Stable Value Products. We offer general account guaranteed interest contracts, 
  separate account guaranteed interest contracts, and similar products used to 
  support the stable value option of defined contribution plans. We also offer 
  private floating rate funding agreements that are used for money market funds, 
  securities lending cash collateral portfolios and short-term investment funds.

General account guaranteed interest contracts are designed to provide stable 
  value investment options within tax-qualified defined contribution plans. Traditional 
  general account guaranteed interest contracts integrate a general account fixed 
  or determinable fixed maturity investment with a general account guarantee of 
  liquidity at contract value for participant transactions.

Separate account guaranteed interest contracts are available to defined contribution 
  plan sponsors. These contracts integrate market value returns on separate account 
  investments with a general account guarantee of liquidity at contract value 
  to the extent the separate account assets are not sufficient. The contracts 
  do not have a fixed maturity date and are terminable by each party on notice.

Private floating rate funding agreements are generally privately-placed, unregistered 
  investment contracts issued as general account obligations. Interest is credited 
  based on an external index, generally the three-month London Interbank Offered 
  Rate (also, LIBOR). Contracts may contain put provisions (of 90 days or longer) 
  that allow for the contractholder to receive the account balance prior to the 
  stated maturity date.
  Pension Closeouts. We offer general account and separate account annuity products, 
  generally in connection with the termination of defined benefit pension plans, 
  both in the U.S. and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). These risk transfer 
  products include single premium buyouts that allow for full or partial transfers 
  of pension liabilities.
General account annuity products include nonparticipating closeout contracts 
  and terminal funding annuity contracts. Under nonparticipating closeout contracts, 
  group annuity benefits may be purchased for retired and terminated employees 
  or employees covered under terminating or ongoing pension plans. Both immediate 
  and deferred annuities may be purchased by a single premium at issue. There 
  are generally no cash surrender rights, with some exceptions including certain 
  contracts that include liabilities for cash balance pension plans. A terminal 
  funding contract is a nonparticipating group annuity contract that is available 
  for purchasing guaranteed payout annuities for employees upon retirement or 
  termination of employment. These annuities can be either life contingent or 
  non-life contingent. These annuities are nonparticipating, do not provide for 
  any loan or cash surrender value, and with few exceptions do not permit future 
  considerations.
 Separate account annuity products include participating closeout contracts. 
  Under participating closeout contracts, group annuity benefits are purchased 
  for retired, terminated, or active employees covered under active or terminated 
  pension plans. Both immediate and deferred fixed annuities are purchased with 
  a single premium. Under some contracts, additional annuities may be periodically 
  purchased at then current purchase rates. The assets supporting the guaranteed 
  benefits for each contract are held in a separate account. Some contracts require 
  the contractholder to make periodic payments to cover investment and insurance 
  expenses. The Company fully guarantees benefit payments and is ultimately responsible 
  for all benefit payments.

Torts and Settlements. We offer innovative strategies for complex litigation 
  settlements, primarily structured settlement annuities.
  Structured settlement annuities are customized annuities designed to serve as 
  an alternative to a lump sum payment in a lawsuit initiated because of personal 
  injury, wrongful death, or a workers’ compensation claim or other claim 
  for damages. Surrenders are generally not allowed, although commutations are 
  permitted in certain circumstances. Guaranteed payments consist of life contingent 
  annuities, term certain annuities and lump sums.

Capital Markets Investment Products. Products we offer include funding agreements, 
  funding agreement-backed notes and funding agreement-backed commercial paper. 
  We also issue funding agreements to receive Federal Home Loan Bank advances 
  and through a program with the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer 
  Mac”).
  Funding agreement-backed notes are part of a medium term note program, under 
  which funding agreements are issued to a special-purpose trust that issues marketable 
  notes in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. The proceeds of the issuance of 
  a series of notes are used by the trust to acquire a funding agreement with 
  matching interest and maturity payment terms from the Company. The notes are 
  underwritten and marketed by major investment banks’ broker-dealer operations 
  and are sold to institutional investors.
  Funding agreement-backed commercial paper is issued by a special purpose limited 
  liability company which deposits the proceeds under a master funding agreement 
  issued to it by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”) or 
  MICC. The commercial paper receives the same short-term credit rating as MLIC 
  or MICC and is marketed by major investment banks’ broker-dealer operations. 
  The program allows for funding agreement-backed commercial paper to be issued 
  in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.
  Through the Farmer Mac program, funding agreements have been issued by MLIC 
  to Farmer Mac, as well as to certain special purpose entities that have issued 
  debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such 
  funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment 
  of interest and principal by Farmer Mac.

Our Health Care business competes in several distinct product categories including 
  Oral Care, Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-counter (OTC) Gastrointestinal and Respiratory 
  Medications and Pet Health and Nutrition. In Oral Care, there are four global 
  competitors in the market, of which we have the number two share position. Our 
  Pharmaceuticals business has almost 30% of the global bisphosphonates market 
  for the treatment of osteoporosis under the Actonel brand. Actonel, along with 
  Crest and Iams.

  In Snacks and Beverages, we compete primarily in two industry categories: Salted 
  Snacks and Coffee. In Salted Snacks, we compete against both global and local 
  companies. One global company dominates the category. In Coffee, we hold a leadership 
  position of the brands sold predominantly through grocery, mass merchandise 
  and club membership stores in the United States (U.S.). We recently completed 
  the divestiture of our Juice business. Two of our billion-dollar brands are 
  in Snacks and Beverages - Pringles and Folgers.

Business Segments DescriptionPrivate Equity
  As a result of our long history of private equity investing across market cycles, 
  we believe we have developed a unique set of skills on which we rely to make 
  new investments and to maximize the value of our existing investments. As an 
  example, through our experience with traditional private equity buyouts, which 
  we also refer to herein as buyout equity, we apply a highly disciplined approach 
  towards structuring and executing transactions, the key tenets of which include 
  seeking to acquire companies at below industry average purchase price multiples, 
  and establishing flexible capital structures with long-term debt maturities 
  and few, if any, financial maintenance covenants.

  We believe we have a demonstrated ability to adapt quickly to changing market 
  environments and capitalize on market dislocations through our traditional, 
  distressed and corporate buyout approach. In prior periods of strained financial 
  liquidity and economic recession, our private equity funds have made attractive 
  investments by buying the debt of quality businesses (which we refer to as “classic” 
  distressed debt), converting that debt to equity, seeking to create value through 
  active participation with management and ultimately monetizing the investment. 
  This combination of traditional and corporate buyout investing with a “distressed 
  option” has been deployed through prior economic cycles and has allowed 
  our funds to achieve attractive long-term rates of return in different economic 
  and market environments. In addition, during prior economic downturns we have 
  relied on our restructuring experience and worked closely with our funds’ 
  portfolio companies to seek to maximize the value of our funds’ investments.

  We seek to focus on investment opportunities where competition is limited or 
  non-existent. We believe we are often sought out early in the investment process 
  because of our industry expertise, sizable amounts of available long-term capital, 
  willingness to pursue investments in complicated situations and ability to provide 
  value-added advice to portfolio companies regarding operational improvements, 
  acquisitions and strategic direction. 
Distressed Buyouts, Debt and Other Investments
  During periods of market dislocation and volatility, we rely on our credit and 
  capital markets expertise to build positions in distressed debt. We target assets 
  with what we believe are high-quality operating businesses but low-quality balance 
  sheets, consistent with our traditional buyout strategies. The distressed securities 
  our funds purchase include bank debt, public high-yield debt and privately held 
  instruments, often with significant downside protection in the form of a senior 
  position in the capital structure, and in certain situations our funds also 
  provide debtor-in-possession financing to companies in bankruptcy. Our investment 
  professionals generate these distressed buyout and debt investment opportunities 
  based on their many years of experience in the debt markets, and as such they 
  are generally proprietary in nature.

  We believe distressed buyouts and debt investments represent a highly attractive 
  risk/reward profile. Our funds’ investments in debt securities have generally 
  resulted in two outcomes. The first and preferred potential outcome, which we 
  refer to as a distressed for control investment, is when our funds are successful 
  in taking control of a company through its investment in the distressed debt. 
  By working proactively through the restructuring process, we are often able 
  to equitize the debt position of our funds to create a well-financed buyout 
  which would then typically be held by the fund for a three-to-five year period, 
  similar to other traditional leveraged buyout transactions. The second potential 
  outcome, which we refer to as a non-control distressed investment is when our 
  funds do not gain control of the company. This typically occurs as a result 
  of an increase in the price of the debt investments to levels which are higher 
  than what we consider to be an attractive acquisition valuation. In these instances, 
  we may forgo seeking control, and instead our funds may seek to sell the debt 
  investments over time, typically generating a higher short-term IRR with a lower 
  multiple of invested capital than in the case of a typical distressed for control 
  transaction. We believe that we are a market leader in distressed investing 
  and that this is one of the key areas that differentiates us from our peers.

  We also maintain the flexibility to deploy capital of our private equity funds 
  in other types of investments such as the creation of new companies, which allows 
  us to leverage our deep industry and distressed expertise and collaborate with 
  experienced management teams to seek to capitalize on market opportunities that 
  we have identified, particularly in asset-intensive industries that are in distress. 
  In these types of situations, we have the ability to establish new entities 
  that can acquire distressed assets at what we believe are attractive valuations 
  without the burden of managing an existing portfolio of legacy assets. Other 
  investments, such as the creation of new companies, historically have not represented 
  a large portion of our overall investment activities, although our private equity 
  funds do make these types of investments selectively.
Corporate Carve-outs
  Corporate Carve-outs are less market-dependent than distressed investing, but 
  are equally complicated. In these transactions, Apollo funds seek to extract 
  a business that is highly integrated within a larger corporate parent to create 
  a stand-alone business. These are labor-intensive transactions, which we believe 
  require deep industry knowledge, patience and creativity, to unlock value that 
  has largely been overlooked or undermanaged. Importantly, because of the highly 
  negotiated nature of many of these transactions, Apollo believes it is often 
  difficult for the seller to run a competitive process, which ultimately allows 
  Apollo funds to achieve compelling purchase prices.

Opportunistic Buyouts
  We have extensive experience completing leveraged buyouts across various market 
  cycles. We take an opportunistic and disciplined approach to these transactions, 
  generally avoiding highly competitive situations in favor of proprietary transactions 
  where there may be opportunities to purchase a company at a discount to prevailing 
  market averages. Oftentimes, we will focus on complex situations such as out-of-favor 
  industries or “broken” (or discontinued) sales processes where the 
  inherent value may be less obvious to potential acquirers. In the case of more 
  conventional buyouts, we seek investment opportunities where we believe our 
  focus on complexity and sector expertise will provide us with a significant 
  competitive advantage, whereby we can leverage our knowledge and experience 
  from the nine core industries in which our investment professionals have historically 
  invested private equity capital. We believe such knowledge and experience can 
  result in our ability to find attractive opportunities for our funds to acquire 
  portfolio company investments at lower purchase price multiples.

  To further alter the risk/reward profile in our funds’ favor, we often 
  focus on certain types of buyouts such as physical asset acquisitions and investments 
  in non-correlated assets where underlying values tend to change in a manner 
  that is independent of broader market movements In the case of physical asset 
  acquisitions, our private equity funds seek to acquire physical assets at discounts 
  to where those assets trade in the financial markets, and to lock in that value 
  arbitrage through comprehensive hedging and structural enhancements.

We believe buyouts of non-correlated assets or businesses also represent attractive 
  investments since they are generally less correlated to the broader economy 
  and provide an element of diversification to our funds' overall portfolio of 
  private equity investments.

Natural Resources
  In addition to our traditional private equity funds which pursue opportunities 
  in nine core industries, one of which is natural resources, we have two dedicated 
  private equity natural resources funds. In 2011, we established our first dedicated 
  private equity natural resources fund, Apollo Natural Resources Partners, L.P. 
  (together with its alternative investment vehicles, “ANRP I”) and 
  assembled a team of dedicated investment professionals to capitalize on private 
  equity investment opportunities in the natural resources industry, principally 
  in the metals and mining, energy and select other natural resources sectors. 

AP Alternative Assets, L.P.
  We also manage AAA, a publicly listed permanent capital vehicle. The sole investment 
  held by AAA is its investment in AAA Investments, L.P. (“AAA Investments”). 
  AAA Investments is the largest equity holder of Athene Holding.
 AAA is a Guernsey limited partnership whose partners are comprised of (i) 
  AAA Guernsey Limited (“AAA Guernsey”), which holds 100% of the general 
  partner interests in AAA, and (ii) the holders of common units representing 
  limited partner interests in AAA. The common units are non-voting and are listed 
  on NYSE Euronext in Amsterdam under the symbol “AAA”. AAA Guernsey 
  is a Guernsey limited company and is owned 55% by an individual who is not an 
  affiliate of Apollo and 45% by Apollo Principal Holdings III, L.P., an indirect 
  subsidiary of Apollo. AAA Guernsey is responsible for managing the business 
  and affairs of AAA. AAA generally makes all of its investments through AAA Investments, 
  of which AAA is the sole limited partner. Athene Holding is AAA Investments’ 
  only investment.
Building Value in Portfolio Companies
  We are a “hands-on” investor organized around nine core industries 
  where we believe we have significant knowledge and expertise, and we remain 
  actively engaged with the management teams of the portfolio companies of our 
  private equity funds. We have established relationships with operating executives 
  that assist in the diligence review of new opportunities and provide strategic 
  and operational oversight for portfolio investments. We actively work with the 
  management of each of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage to maximize 
  the underlying value of the business. To achieve this, we take a holistic approach 
  to value-creation, concentrating on both the asset side and liability side of 
  the balance sheet of a company. On the asset side of the balance sheet, Apollo 
  works with management of the portfolio companies to enhance the operations of 
  such companies. Our investment professionals assist portfolio companies in rationalizing 
  non-core and underperforming assets, generating cost and working capital savings, 
  and maximizing liquidity. On the liability side of the balance sheet, Apollo 
  relies on its deep credit structuring experience and works with management of 
  the portfolio companies to help optimize the capital structure of such companies 
  through proactive restructuring of the balance sheet to address near-term debt 
  maturities. The companies in which our private equity funds invest also seek 
  to capture discounts on publicly traded debt securities through exchange offers 
  and potential debt buybacks. In addition, we have established a group purchasing 
  program to help our funds' portfolio companies leverage the combined corporate 
  spending among Apollo and portfolio companies of the funds it manages in order 
  to seek to reduce costs, optimize payment terms and improve service levels for 
  all program participants.

Exiting Investments
  The value of the investments that have been made by our funds are typically 
  realized through either an initial public offering of common stock on a nationally 
  recognized exchange or through the private sale of the companies in which our 
  funds have invested. We believe the advantage of having long-lived funds and 
  investment discretion is that we are able to time our funds’ exit to maximize 
  value.
Credit
  Since Apollo’s founding in 1990, we believe our expertise in credit has 
  served as an integral component of our company’s growth and success. Our 
  credit-oriented approach to investing commenced in 1990 with the management 
  of a high-yield bond and leveraged loan portfolio. Since that time, our credit 
  activities have grown significantly, through both organic growth and strategic 
  acquisitions. 
Liquid/Performing
Our liquid/performing category within the credit segment generally includes 
  funds and accounts where the underlying assets are liquid in nature and/or have 
  some form of periodic redemption right. Liquid/performing includes a variety 
  of hedge funds, CLOs and SIAs that utilize a range of investment strategies 
  including performing credit, structured credit, and liquid opportunistic credit. 
  Performing credit strategies focus on income-oriented, senior loan and bond 
  investment strategies that target issuers primarily domiciled in the U.S. and 
  in Europe. Structured credit strategies target multiple tranches of structured 
  securities with favorable and protective lending terms, predictable payment 
  schedules, well diversified portfolios and low default rates. Liquid opportunistic 
  strategies primarily focus on credit investments that are generally liquid in 
  nature and that utilize a similar value-oriented investment philosophy as our 
  private equity business. This includes investments by our credit funds in a 
  broad array of primary and secondary opportunities encompassing stressed and 
  distressed public and private securities primarily within corporate credit, 
  including senior loans (secured and unsecured), 
Hedge Funds
  Our credit hedge funds may utilize a mix of the investment strategies outlined 
  above. Investments in these funds may be made on a long or short basis and employ 
  leverage to finance the acquisition of various credit investments. Accordingly, 
  the difference between AUM and Fee-Generating AUM for hedge funds is driven 
  by non-fee paying leverage.

CLOs
  CLOs includes more than 20 internally managed CLOs focused within the U.S. and 
  Europe. In aggregate, our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM in CLOs totaled $13.4 billion 
  as of December 31, 2015. Through their lifecycle, CLOs employ structured credit 
  and performing credit strategies with the goal of providing investors with competitive 
  yields achieved through highly diversified pools of historically low defaulting 
  assets.

SIAs / Other
  SIAs / Other includes a diverse group of separately managed accounts and certain 
  commitment-based funds where the underlying assets are liquid and generally 
  employ a mix of performing credit, structured credit, and liquid opportunistic 
  credit investment strategies. In aggregate, our AUM and Fee-Generating in SIAs 
  and other accounts totaled $16.7 billion and $14.6 billion as of December 31, 
  2015, respectively. The managed accounts comprising the majority of AUM and 
  Fee-Generating AUM within this subcategory are customized according to an investor’s 
  specified risk and target return preferences.

Drawdown
  Our drawdown category within the credit segment generally includes commitment-based 
  funds and certain SIAs in which investors make a commitment to provide capital 
  at the formation of such funds and deliver capital when called as investment 
  opportunities become available. Drawdown comprises our fund series’ including 
  Credit Opportunity Funds, European Principal Finance Funds, and Structured Credit 
  Funds, including Financial Credit Investment Funds and Structured Credit Recovery 
  Funds, as well as other commitment-based funds not included within a series 
  of funds and certain SIAs. Drawdown funds and SIAs utilize a range of investment 
  strategies including illiquid opportunistic, principal finance, and structured 
  credit strategies. 

Credit Opportunity Funds (“COF”)
  The Credit Opportunity Fund series primarily employs our illiquid opportunistic 
  investment strategy, which focuses on credit investments that are less liquid 
  in nature and that utilize a similar value-oriented investment philosophy as 
  our private equity business. This includes investments in a broad array of primary 
  and secondary opportunities encompassing stressed and distressed public and 
  private securities primarily within corporate credit, including senior loans 
  (secured and unsecured), high yield, mezzanine, debtor in possession financings, 
  rescue or bridge financings, and other debt investments. Additionally, for certain 
  illiquid opportunistic investments our underwriting process may result in selective 
  and at times concentrated investments by the funds in the various industries 
  on which we focus. In certain cases, leverage can be employed in connection 
  with this strategy by having fund subsidiaries or special-purpose vehicles incur 
  debt or by entering into credit facilities or other debt transactions to finance 
  the acquisition of various credit investments.
European Principal Finance Funds (“EPF”)
The European Principal Finance Fund series primarily employs our principal 
  finance investment strategy, which is utilized to invest in European commercial 
  and residential real estate, performing loans, non-performing loans, and unsecured 
  consumer loans, as well as acquiring assets as a result of distressed market 
  situations. Certain of the EPF investment vehicles we manage own captive pan-European 
  financial institutions, loan servicing and property management platforms. 
Structured Credit Funds - FCI and SCRF
  Our Structured Credit Funds include the Financial Credit Investment Fund series 
  (“FCI”) and the Structured Credit Recovery Fund series (“SCRF”). 
  Collectively, the Structured Credit Funds employ our structured credit investing 
  strategy, which targets multiple tranches of less liquid structured securities 
  with favorable and protective lending terms, predictable payment schedules, 
  well-diversified portfolios and low default rates. 

Permanent Capital Vehicles - Credit
  Our permanent capital vehicles category within the credit segment generally 
  includes pools of assets which are not subject to redemption and are generally 
  associated with long term asset management or advisory contracts. This category 
  is comprised of (a) Athene Asset Management and an affiliate of Apollo which 
  provides advisory services to Athene Germany; (b) assets that are owned by or 
  related to Midcap and managed by Apollo Capital Management, L.P.; (c) assets 
  of certain publicly traded vehicles managed by Apollo such as AINV, AMTG, AIF, 
  and AFT and (d) a non-traded business development company sub-advised by Apollo. 
  The permanent capital vehicles within credit utilize a range of investment strategies 
  including performing credit and structured credit as described previously, as 
  well as directly originated credit. Direct origination generally relates to 
  the sourcing of senior credit assets, both secured and unsecured, including 
  asset-backed loans, leveraged loans, mezzanine debt, real estate loans, re-discount 
  loans and venture loans. Directly originated credit is primarily employed by 
  Midcap, AINV, and a non-traded business development company sub-advised by Apollo.

  Permanent Capital Vehicles excluding Athene Non-Sub-Advised Assets
  This category includes all permanent capital vehicles within the credit segment 
  described above except for the portion of Athene Asset Management that is not 
  sub-advised by Apollo or invested in Apollo funds. 

Athene Non-Sub-Advised Assets
  This category includes (i) the assets which are managed by Athene Asset Management 
  but not sub-advised by Apollo nor invested in Apollo funds or Investment Vehicles 
  and (ii) assets related to Athene Germany for which an affiliate of Apollo provides 
  advisory services. We refer to these assets collectively as “Athene Non-Sub-Advised 
  Assets”. 
Athene
  As discussed in the preceding section, permanent capital vehicles within the 
  credit segment includes Athene Asset Management and an affiliate of Apollo which 
  provides advisory services to Athene Germany. 
Real Estate
  Our real estate group has a dedicated team of multi-disciplinary real estate 
  professionals whose investment activities are integrated and coordinated with 
  our private equity and credit business segments. We take a broad view of markets 
  and property types in targeting debt and equity investment opportunities, including 
  the acquisition and recapitalization of real estate portfolios, platforms and 
  operating companies and distressed for control situations. 
With respect to our real estate funds' equity investments, we take a value-oriented 
  approach and our funds will invest in assets located in primary, secondary and 
  tertiary markets across the United States. The funds we manage pursue opportunistic 
  investments in various real estate asset classes, which historically have included 
  hospitality, office, industrial, retail, healthcare, residential and non-performing 
  loans. Our real estate equity funds under management currently include AGRE 
  U.S. Real Estate Fund, L.P. (“U.S. RE Fund I”) and Apollo U.S. Real 
  Estate Fund II, L.P. (“U.S. RE Fund II”), our U.S. focused, opportunistic 
  funds, and our legacy Citi Property Investors (“CPI”) business, 
  the real estate investment management business we acquired from Citigroup in 
  November 2010. In 2015, we expanded our real estate equity strategy through 
  the acquisition of Venator Real Estate Capital Partners (“Venator”), 
  an Asian focused real estate investment manager. In connection with the transaction, 
  we now manage the Trophy Property Development Fund, a China-focused investment 
  fund.

Business Segments DescriptionCommercial Airplanes Segment 
The Commercial Airplanes segment is involved in developing, producing and marketing 
  commercial jet aircraft and providing related support services, principally 
  to the commercial airline industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial 
  aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad 
  spectrum of passenger and cargo requirements of domestic and foreign airlines. 
  This family of commercial jet aircraft currently includes the 717 and 737 Next-Generation 
  narrow-body models and the 747, 767 and 777 wide-body models. Final delivery 
  of the MD-11 aircraft occurred in 2001. Final delivery of the 757 aircraft is 
  scheduled to occur in the second quarter of 2005. 
Commercial jet aircraft are normally sold on a fixed-price basis with an indexed 
  price escalation clause. Our ability to deliver jet aircraft on schedule depends 
  on a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, 
  availability of raw materials, performance of suppliers and subcontractors, 
  and regulatory certification. The introduction of new and derivative commercial 
  aircraft programs involves increased risks associated with meeting development, 
  production and certification schedules. 
The major focus of commercial aircraft development activities over the past 
  three years has been the 737 Next-Generation-900 model, the 747-400ER, the 747-400ERF, 
  the 777-200LR, and the 777-300ER. The initial delivery of the 737-900, the largest 
  member of the 737 Next-Generation family, occurred in the second quarter of 
  2001. Certification and first delivery of the 747-400ER and 747-400ERF occurred 
  during the fourth quarter of 2002. Certification and first delivery of the 777-300ER 
  and 777-200LR is scheduled for 2004 and 2006, respectively. 
The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely 
  competitive. We face aggressive international competitors, including Airbus, 
  that are intent on increasing their market share. To effectively compete, we 
  focus on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We continue 
  to leverage our extensive customer support services network for airlines throughout 
  the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity.

Boeing Capital Corporation Segment 
Historically, BCC has acted as a captive finance subsidiary by providing market-based 
  lease and loan financing for commercial aircraft as well as commercial equipment. 
  In November 2003, we announced a significant change in BCC’s strategic direction, 
  moving from a focus on growing the portfolio to a focus on supporting our major 
  operating units and managing overall corporate exposures. For our commercial 
  aircraft market, BCC will facilitate, arrange, and selectively provide financing 
  to Commercial Airplanes’ customers. For our defense and space markets, BCC will 
  primarily arrange and structure financing solutions for IDS’s government customers. 
  In addition, BCC will enhance the risk management activities to reduce exposures 
  associated with the current portfolio. BCC expects to satisfy any external funding 
  needs through access to traditional market funding sources. 

  BCC competes in the commercial equipment leasing and finance markets, primarily 
  in the United States, against a number of competitors, mainly larger leasing 
  companies and banks. BCC’s Commercial Financial Services’ portfolio encompasses 
  multiple industries and a wide range of equipment, including corporate aircraft, 
  machine tools and production equipment, containers and marine equipment, chemical, 
  oil and gas equipment and other equipment types. Historically, approximately 
  20% of BCC’s portfolio was related to commercial equipment leasing and financing 
  activities. In January 2004, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives 
  for the future of BCC’s Commercial Financial Services business. The alternatives 
  being examined include a sale of the operation itself, sale of the portfolio 
  or a phased wind-down of the existing portfolio.
